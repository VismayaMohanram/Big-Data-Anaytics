### 🗃️ **Database / Dataset**
- **Flat File Dataset (.CSV)** – All data was processed directly from CSV files using `pandas`.
  - **COVID-19 Symptoms Checker Dataset**
    - 📥 [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamhungundji/covid19-symptoms-checker)
    - 📊 Based on data provided by the **World Health Organization (WHO)**

> 💡 No external database systems (e.g., SQL, NoSQL) were used. All data was handled in-memory using pandas.


Implemented a comparative analysis of ML algorithms on a WHO dataset, evaluating performance, speed, and accuracy.

Investigated the potential of TensorFlow to enhance accuracy in machine learning applications. Developed and implemented a pipeline utilizing the TPOT classifier for automated feature selection, aiming to achieve superior model performance.

Leveraged comprehensive data analysis, visualization, and diverse machine learning techniques to achieve significant model accuracies, with the Neural Network demonstrating the highest accuracy.
